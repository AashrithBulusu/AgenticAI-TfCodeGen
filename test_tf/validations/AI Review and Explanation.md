# Terraform Configuration Review

## AI Review

### Errors
1. **Invalid `required_version` Syntax**:
   - The `required_version` in the `terraform` block uses a comma `,` instead of a logical operator. The correct syntax should use `>= 1.9` and `< 2.0` separated by a space.
   - **Fix**: Update the `required_version` to:
     ```hcl
     required_version = ">= 1.9 < 2.0"
     ```

2. **Hardcoded Sensitive Data**:
   - The `admin_password` and `domain_join_password` variables are hardcoded in the `module "test"` block. This is a security risk as sensitive data should not be stored in plain text within the configuration.
   - **Fix**: Replace the hardcoded values with references to sensitive variables:
     ```hcl
     admin_password        = var.vm_admin_password
     domain_join_password  = var.domain_join_password
     ```

3. **Invalid `features` Block in `azurerm` Provider**:
   - The `features` block in the `azurerm` provider contains an unsupported attribute `resource_group { prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources = false }`. The `features` block does not support nested configurations.
   - **Fix**: Remove the unsupported attribute:
     ```hcl
     provider "azurerm" {
       subscription_id = "0000000-0000-00000-000000"
       features {}
     }
     ```

4. **Missing Default Values for Sensitive Variables**:
   - The `vm_admin_password` and `domain_join_password` variables are marked as sensitive but do not have default values. This can cause issues during deployment if these values are not provided.
   - **Fix**: Ensure these variables are passed during runtime or provide default values securely (e.g., via environment variables or a secrets manager).

5. **Potential Issue with `data_disk_params` Default**:
   - The `data_disk_params` variable has a default value of `{}`, which is a map, but the description refers to an "array." This could cause confusion or errors if the expected type is not consistent.
   - **Fix**: Update the description to reflect the correct type (map) or change the type to `list(object(...))` if an array is intended.

### Best Practices
1. **Use `locals` for Repeated Expressions**:
   - The `parent_id` attribute in multiple `azapi_resource` data blocks references `data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.id`. This can be extracted into a `locals` block for better readability and maintainability.
   - **Suggestion**:
     ```hcl
     locals {
       resource_group_id = data.azurerm_resource_group.rg.id
     }

     data "azapi_resource" "customlocation" {
       type      = "Microsoft.ExtendedLocation/customLocations@2021-08-15"
       name      = var.custom_location_name
       parent_id = local.resource_group_id
     }
     ```

2. **Enable Provider Version Pinning**:
   - The `azurerm` provider is pinned to `~> 4.0`, which allows for minor version updates. Consider pinning to a specific version (e.g., `= 4.5.0`) to avoid unexpected changes during updates.

3. **Use `for_each` for Dynamic Resources**:
   - If multiple `data_disk_params` are provided, consider using `for_each` to dynamically create resources instead of relying on manual configurations.

4. **Add Comments for Sensitive Variables**:
   - Add comments to sensitive variables (e.g., `vm_admin_password`) to remind users to securely manage these values (e.g., via environment variables or a secrets manager).

5. **Enable Logging and Diagnostics**:
   - Consider enabling logging and diagnostics for Azure resources to improve observability and troubleshooting.

### Completeness
1. **Missing Resource Group Creation**:
   - The configuration assumes that the resource group already exists. If this is not guaranteed, add a `azurerm_resource_group` resource to create it dynamically.
   - **Example**:
     ```hcl
     resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
       name     = var.resource_group_name
       location = var.location
     }
     ```

2. **No Output Variables**:
   - The configuration does not include any `output` blocks to expose important information (e.g., VM ID, IP address). Adding outputs can improve usability.
   - **Example**:
     ```hcl
     output "vm_id" {
       value = module.test.vm_id
     }
     ```

3. **No State Locking Configuration**:
   - There is no backend configuration for state management. Consider adding a remote backend (e.g., Azure Storage) to enable state locking and collaboration.

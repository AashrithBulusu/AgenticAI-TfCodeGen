# Terraform Configuration Review

## AI Review

### Errors
1. **Output Variable Sensitive Data**:
   - The `outputs.tf` file exposes sensitive data such as `admin_password` and `domain_join_password`. This is a security risk as sensitive information should not be exposed in outputs.
   - **Fix**: Use the `sensitive = true` attribute in the output block to mark sensitive outputs and avoid exposing them.

   ```hcl
   output "azurestackhci_virtual_machine_admin_password" {
     value     = module.azurestackhci_virtual_machine.admin_password
     sensitive = true
   }
   ```

2. **Unused Variables**:
   - Some variables in `variables.tf` are defined but not used in the configuration files. For example, `proxy_vm_tags` in `azurestackhci_virtual_machine_config` is defined but not referenced in `main.tf`.
   - **Fix**: Remove unused variables or ensure they are used in the configuration.

3. **Inconsistent Naming**:
   - The `load_balancer_config` variable uses inconsistent casing for the `location` field (`East US` vs `eastus` in other configurations). This can lead to deployment issues.
   - **Fix**: Standardize the casing to `eastus`.

4. **Missing Required Fields**:
   - In `network_interface_config`, the `edge_zone` field is set to `edge-zone-1`, but the corresponding Azure region may not support edge zones. Ensure compatibility before deployment.
   - **Fix**: Validate the edge zone against the Azure region.

5. **Potential Hardcoding of Sensitive Data**:
   - Hardcoded sensitive values like `admin_password` and `domain_join_password` in `terraform.tfvars` are a security risk.
   - **Fix**: Use secure methods like environment variables or secret management tools (e.g., Azure Key Vault).

### Best Practices
1. **Module Version Pinning**:
   - While module versions are pinned, consider using a range (e.g., `~> 0.4.0`) to allow minor updates without breaking compatibility.

2. **Enable Resource Locking**:
   - Resource locks are defined but not consistently applied across all resources. Ensure critical resources (e.g., `sql_server`, `storage_account`) have locks to prevent accidental deletion.

3. **Use `locals` for Repeated Values**:
   - Repeated values like `location` and `resource_group_name` can be defined as `locals` to improve maintainability.

   ```hcl
   locals {
     location            = "eastus"
     resource_group_name = "example-resource-group"
   }
   ```

4. **Sensitive Data Management**:
   - Use Terraform's `sensitive` attribute for sensitive outputs and avoid exposing sensitive data in logs or outputs.

5. **Validation Rules**:
   - Add validation rules for variables to ensure correct values are provided. For example:

   ```hcl
   variable "location" {
     type        = string
     description = "Azure region"
     validation {
       condition     = contains(["eastus", "westus", "centralus"], var.location)
       error_message = "Invalid Azure region. Valid values are eastus, westus, and centralus."
     }
   }
   ```

### Completeness
1. **Diagnostic Settings**:
   - Diagnostic settings are configured for most resources, but ensure all critical resources (e.g., `sql_server`, `network_security_group`) have diagnostic settings enabled.

2. **Role Assignments**:
   - Role assignments are defined but ensure they are applied to all resources requiring specific access control.

3. **Resource Dependencies**:
   - Ensure dependencies between resources are explicitly defined (e.g., `depends_on`) where necessary to avoid deployment issues.

## AI Explanation of Linting Issues and How to Fix

### 1. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - **Issue**: Sensitive data like `admin_password` and `domain_join_password` are exposed in outputs.
   - **Fix**: Use the `sensitive = true` attribute in output blocks to prevent exposing sensitive data.

### 2. **Unused Variables**
   - **Issue**: Variables like `proxy_vm_tags` are defined but not used, leading to unnecessary complexity.
   - **Fix**: Remove unused variables or ensure they are referenced in the configuration.

### 3. **Inconsistent Naming**
   - **Issue**: The `location` field in `load_balancer_config` uses inconsistent casing (`East US` vs `eastus`).
   - **Fix**: Standardize the casing to `eastus` across all configurations.

### 4. **Hardcoded Sensitive Data**
   - **Issue**: Sensitive values like `admin_password` are hardcoded in `terraform.tfvars`.
   - **Fix**: Use secure methods like environment variables or secret management tools (e.g., Azure Key Vault).
